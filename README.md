<strong>This project was carried out during a course on the Alura platform</strong>

In this project I created an example of a system for registering patients, which automatically calculates the body mass index (BMI).

In the second moment I added validation so that the correct patient data is mandatory.

Once added, the patient appears last in the table.

I created a "search" button that performs an AJAX request to the database and displays other previously registered patients.

Finally I incremented the filter that as the user types it displays the result in the table
